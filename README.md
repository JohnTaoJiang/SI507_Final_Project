## Proposal

## Part 1 - Data Gathering

Collect data by Yelp API with OAuth authentication. Yelp client library may also be used.

## Part 2 - Cache System

## Part 3 - Class Designed for Processing Data from API

Design 3 classes, restaurant, service, deal to extract and represent the raw data

## Part 4 - Building Database

Store the data into 4 different tables in database, which are Restaurants, locations, actions and deals.

## Part 5 - Test Suite

## Part 6 - Visualization of Data

Create kinds of charts by Plotly, which can be as following:
Average rating of each areaâ€™s restaurants(histogram)
Number/percentage of restaurants rated above 4 for each area(histogram)
Ratio of having deals in restaurants rated above 4 for each area(pie chart)
Ratio of having services(e.g. Delivering via Eat24, Booking via Seatme) in restaurants rated above 4 for each area(pie chart)
